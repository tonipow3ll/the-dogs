    age: "10",
    breed: "Basset Hound",
    bio: "Bonnie is a 10 year old basset hound. She has hiked many mountains in her younger years, and these days prefers to lounge around on the couch, in a nice sun spot near the heater, or outside on the deck in her older age. She absolutely adores her brothers Jack, and Boston. But Jack is her absolute best friend in the world",
    profile: "Bonnie is a true blooded basset hound. If you let her wander, she will follow her nose. She is trained to stay within bounds of the house with Petsafe's 'Invisible Fence' collar. We do ask that you keep an eye on her while she is outside. She is very stubborn, and sometimes has to be coaxed inside with a treat (usually holding up a milkbone and calling her will get do the trick). Bonnie likes to be let out first thing in the morning, a few times during the day (she will scratch at the door to let you know she needs to go out), and right before bedtime.",

    name: "Jack Bauer",
    age: "9",
    breed: "Golden Retriever",
    bio: "Jack is a 9 year old golden retriever. His favorite activities are fetch, and hockey (he LOVES his foam pucks!). Jack wants nothing more than to be around people (and Bonnie!). He loves a good run around the yard playing fetch or hockey, and will happily lounge on the couch with you after a good play session. Jack is bonded with Bonnie, and is learning to live with Boston. He has been a great older brother, but does get frustrated if Boston doesn't mind his manners.",
    profile: "Jack Bauer is the epitome of 'golden retriever'. His greatest joy in life is playing fetch. His second greatest joy is hanging with Bonnie. Jack does have a tendency to 'not know when to stop', in the summer months he is prone to overheating. We ask that you be mindful with his play sessions especially outdoors in the heat. He often needs to be brought inside to cool off before he wants to be 'done'. He knows 'last throw', and will come inside when called to drink water and eat ice cubes. We do not allow balls inside the house, so when bringing him in he knows 'leave it'. He will try to sneak balls inside, so keep an eye out! Jack likes to be let out in the morning, and a few times during the day, and right before bedtime.",
    likes: "fetch, hockey, belly rubs, head scratches/pets, giving kisses, snuggling",
    dislikes: "other dogs (except Bonnie and Boston!)",

    name: "Boston",
    age: "4",
    breed: "Golden Retriever",
    bio: "Boston is a 4 year old golden retriever. He is the newest addition to our pack (he has been with us since December 2023). Boston loves to get zoomies around the yard and steal Jack's ball during fetch sessions. He doesn't quite understand that we don't rip up the foam pucks. Boston loves everybody he meets, and wants nothing more than pets, praises, and maybe a good sniff walk if the weather permits. Boston is a BIG boy, and does not always realize his size. He is learning how to mind his manners, and not to step on toes (literally).",
    profile: "Boston is a big love bug. He is very quiet, and is more than happy to have a relaxed day. He does enjoy long walks where he can explore the world through different smells, and keep up on his leash manners (he walks very well). We do have a prong collar that we use for walks - he has been known to get excited and not realize his size/strength. Boston will wander into the woods if allowed, so he is also trained on Petsafe's 'Invisible Fence'. We ask that you keep an eye on him while he is outside, as he has been known to try and sneak around the barrier. Boston likes to go out first thing in the morning, a few times during the day, and right before bedtime. ",
